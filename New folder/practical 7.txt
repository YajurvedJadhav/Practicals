(a) Pizza parlor accepting maximum M orders. Orders are served on a first come first served basis.
Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the creation of a
job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use priorities, then the jobs are
processed in the order they enter the system. Write a program for simulating job queue. Write
functions to add jobs and delete jobs from the queue.
